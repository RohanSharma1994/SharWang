# Description
Squatter is an intelligent game playing agent for the board game 'Squatter' which is implemented using the following:
  1. Minimax Algorithm which cuts off at a certain depth.
  2. A heuristic(utility) function which indicates how desirable a given state is for the agent which will be used to determine which move to make before a terminal state is reached.
  3. Alpha-Beta pruning to improve the time & search complexity for the minimax algorithm.
  4. Temporal learning using the TD-Leaf algorithm so our heuristic function's weights are adjusted according the kind of opponent we are playing.
